My passion for software development was sparked when the pandemic first hit. I was determined to change my life around and came across computer science as a major in school. For the past year, I have been focusing on my personal and professional growth where I have been self teaching and attending school to progress my programming knowledge. I find great satisfaction being able to solve complex problems, and helping people to solve those types of problems as well.As a software engineer, Iâ€™m excited to bring my motivation and problem solving skills to the workforce and help progress humanity in the right direction."
